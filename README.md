# CS6910 ASSIGNMENT 1
### Dharanivendhan v (ed22s006)
#### Instructions to train and evaluate neural network models:
1. Install the libraries required for the project using the command below:
[pip install -r requirements.txt]

2.There are two ways to use the notebook #"DEEP LEARNING_Assignment1.ipynb"# to train a neural network model for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using categorical cross-entropy loss:
a. To use the best values for hyperparameters obtained from the wandb sweeps functionality, skip running cells in the section titled "Hyperparameter tuning using Sweeps" and run all other cells of the notebook to train the model. The final model will be trained on the entire training set and evaluated on the test set.
b. If you want to perform the hyperparameter manually feed it yourself, run the entire notebook.

3.To train the neural network model using mean squared error loss function for Fashion-MNIST image classification use the notebook #Assignment1_MSE#.Instructions apply same as above

4.To train the MNIST dataset for the best three hyper-parameter configurations, access the notebook #assignment_1_MNIST.
5.

Note:please remember to change the name of the project in the corresponding line of code whenever you need to log in wandb
