# Character-level Neural Machine Transliteration (Seq2Seq) with Attention

This repository contains an implementation of a character-level neural machine transliteration model with attention mechanism using PyTorch. The model is designed to transliterate English words into Hindi. 

## Overview

The transliteration model consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism. The encoder processes the input English sequence, while the decoder generates the corresponding Hindi transliteration character by character. The attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence during the generation process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-machine-transliteration.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the English-Hindi transliteration dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input data/english.txt --output data/hindi.txt
   ```

2. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py --source data/english.txt --target data/hindi.txt --epochs 20 --batch_size 64
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model models/model.pth --source data/english_test.txt --target data/hindi_test.txt
   ```

4. Transliterate new input:

   ```bash
   python transliterate.py --model models/model.pth --input "Hello, world!"
   ```

## Model Configuration

The model architecture, including the number of layers, hidden units, and attention mechanism, can be configured by modifying the `config.py` file.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation set and demonstrates good performance in transliterating English words to Hindi.
